                    <b>Fashion: More Than Just Clothes</b> <br><br>
                    
                    Many people think of fashion as just the clothes we wear, but it's much more than that.

This year, Copenhagen is putting a special focus on unique fashion pieces from talented Nordic designers, showcasing creativity and sustainability.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>Thrift Shopping: A Key Trend</b><br><br>
                    
                    Copenhagen is encouraging fashion lovers to rethink their shopping habits. Thrift shopping is becoming a major trend, offering affordable, one-of-a-kind items found in second-hand stores. This not only helps reduce waste but also supports sustainable fashion by giving pre-loved items a second life.<br><br>

Throughout the week, workshops and panel discussions provide valuable insights on sustainable fashion practices. Industry leaders, environmentalists, and designers come together to share their expertise and discuss the importance of eco-consciousness in fashion.<br><br>
