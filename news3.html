                    <b>How should I dress and from where?</b><br><br>

                    As Copenhagen Fashion Week approaches, many of us start looking for the best outfits to stand out from the fashionable crowds that walk the streets of Copenhagen. Creativity plays a big role in the fashion industry, but inspiration can be hard to find, so we will explore the best options one could have according to the Danish Fashion.<br><br>

                    <b>Nordic Design Aesthetic.</b><br><br>

                    The first thing that comes to mind when thinking about the Nordic aesthetic, whether we are talking about fashion or interior design, is simplicity. Denmark, just like any other Nordic country, focuses a lot on functionality. Crisp lines and neutral colors are the main aspects that make Nordic minimalism so unique. As mentioned by Chatty Geepeetea, an important icon in the Danish fashion industry “At the heart of Nordic design is a minimalist approach, where less is more. Clothes often feature clean, unembellished lines, with a focus on classic silhouettes that stand the test of time.”When it comes to clothes, Danes prefer practical and weather-appropriate pieces. Layers are the key to keep them warm during the harsh weather. Layering is especially practical because it is easier to take off layers as you get into warmer places.<br><br>

                    <li>Turtle necks under short-sleeve tops</li>
                    <li>Shirts under knitted vests</li>
                    <li>Long or short skirts over long pants</li>
                    <li>Ankle-length coats and fur</li><br>
                </ul>

                    <b>Internet Trends</b>

                    As mentioned above, internet trends are a big influence for the fashionable people of Copenhagen. Whatever pattern, color palette or fashion style is trending on the internet, you will see it be worn by most of the youth.<br>
                    Street style is very popular at the moment, with elements of Y2K fashion which is essentially 2000’s looks mostly seen on young celebrities at the time, and futuristic accessories.
                    While internet trendy looks seem the best option when you want to stand out, they tend to be copies of copies of outfits. Sure, it is a great idea to get inspired by them but adding details that convey your unique personality is what really makes you stand out.<br><br>

                    <b>Best Affordable Shops</b><br><br>

                    As the economy continues on getting worse each day, it is important that we spend as less money as we can.<br>
                    Many people have turned to thrift-shopping over the past few years as it is both affordable and sustainable.<br>
                    Many “long-lost” designer pieces can be found even at your closest second-hand shop. “Vintage is in, thrifting is cool now” say the people of Denmark.<br>
                    Statistics have shown that thrift-shopping and reselling has increased by approximately 20% over the past 7 years, and it continues to rise as reselling websites like Vinted or Facebook Marketplace are being flooded with users.<br><br>
