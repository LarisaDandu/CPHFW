                <h1>FASHION'S GENDER GAP: EXPLORING THE DIFFERENCES IN PARTICIPATION AND INFLUENCE</h1>
                <img src="resources/images/drag icon.jpg" alt="Drag" class="drag-icon">
            
                <p><b>IS FASHION REALLY FOR EVERYONE?</b><br><br>
                    Living in today's first world society we all must make choices of what to wear every day, so it seems like fashion should be for for everyone, but is it really? There's a big difference between how men and women experience the fashion world. <br>
                    Women buy more clothes, follow more trends, and even study fashion more often. But when it comes to who's in charge, men still hold a lot of the top jobs. This article explores the gender gap in fashion, looking at how men and women participate in different ways and who has the most influence. It's time to uncover the hidden inequalities that shape what we wear and who gets to decide what's "in style."<br><br>
                    
                    <b>GENDER GAP STATISTICS</b><br><br>
                    Reality is that women participate in the fashion world at much higher rates. But even though over 85 % of fashion school graduates are women and they make up 70 % of the total workforce, only less than 25% of them hold leadership positions and another surprising fact is that the gender disparity in fashion is even worse than in Aerospace or Finance industries.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>WHY THE IMBALANCE?</b><br><br>
                     There are several factors contribute to this imbalance. Unconscious bias, lack of mentorship for women, and the challenge of balancing work and family life all play a role. The industry's demanding schedule and pressure to conform to certain beauty standards can also disproportionately affect women. I addition to that fashion has a long history of reinforcing traditional gender roles and expectations. This legacy is hard to shake off, and many structures and practices within the industry still reflect these outdated norms.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>MEN'S SIDE</b><br><br>
                    But I think it's important to look at the other side of the spectrum which is men and fashion. While they might not face the same barriers to entry, men are also affected by the gender gap in the industry. They often feel limited by narrow definitions of masculinity and a lack of options for self-expression through clothing. Societal pressures and workplace dress codes can reinforce traditional gender roles, leaving little room for men to explore their personal style. This can lead to feelings of restriction, a lack of confidence, and even body image issues. It's crucial to recognize that the fashion industry's gender gap affects everyone and creating a more inclusive and equitable space will benefit men just as much as women.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>CONCLUSION</b><br><br>
                    Fashion can seem unfair to both women and men. Women are often the ones buying and wearing the clothes, but they don't have as much say in how the fashion world works. Men also feel pressure to dress a certain way, which can be limiting and make them feel insecure. To make fashion better for everyone, we need to get rid of old ideas about what men and women should wear and how they should act. We need to make sure everyone feels welcome and has the chance to succeed, no matter their gender. If we do this, fashion can be a place where everyone feels good about themselves and can express who they are.<br><br></p>
